Refactored jgroups-raft for better understanding. 
============

Implementation of the RAFT [1] consensus algorithm in JGroups. For the design, look into `doc`.

To generate the manual execute `ant manual` (requires `asciidoctor`).

Discussions on design and implementation are at [2].

The web page is here: [3].

There's an IRC at #jgroups-raft.
